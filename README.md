# Important

If you clone the repo, change the repo name to lower-case, at the beginning when running `npx create-react-app ticTacBlock` It gave me an error: "name can no longer contain capital letters" because npm naming restrictions

# ticTacBlock

A tic-tac-toe in a local blockchain? Who want's that? I don't know but hey, I've done stupidest things.  

The tic-tac-toe game is going to be made following `REACT JS`, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. After following the tutorial on their web page: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html I will add the blockchain (I don't know how yet...but will figure it out).


# Project Creation Commands

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Create React App: `npx create-react-app app-name`
3. Inside `app-name` run `npm start`
4. Following the tutorial I've deleted the files inside `src/`.
